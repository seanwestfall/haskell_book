## Introduction
There are two separate topics in the subject of type checking. The first is (1) unification, and the second is (2) type inference. Unification is a process of checking that the types that are being used, after using a form of deduction, match and are being used in the expression in the intended way as their types of defined. Type inference is the process by which the types of an expression are infered (~guessed) from their expression. Type inference can vary from language to language, and in the case of haskell the typing rules used are called the Hindley–Milner (HM) type system or Damas–Hindley–Milner.
