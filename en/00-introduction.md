### Title

This text contains an explanation of how to build statically type checked programming languages. For the definition of what a statically typed checked language is, it's a language where during the compile step (not the execution), static analysis is applied to the code, and then a decision is returned with whether the code can run or not, in the binary sense. Any language where there is no compile step, with a decision step, is a dynamically type language. Even if parts of the language are compiled, then excuted, without a decision step, it's a dynamically typed programming language. So in a very strict definition, any language where there is a compile step, where the compile makes a decision whether the program can run or not, is a statically typed language -- all other cases are dynamically typed.
