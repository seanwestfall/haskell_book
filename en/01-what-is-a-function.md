# What is a Function...

## What is a Function
In mathematics, a function is a relation between sets that associates to every element of a first set exactly one element of the second set. Typical examples are functions from integers to integers or from the real numbers to real numbers.

I good way to learn what a function is, is by learning what is not a function.

A Great trick that many are taught in high school, is called the vertical line test

## Properties of Functions

### Composition
Composition is the mapping, from inputs to outputs of two function, into each other, when plugged together, function inputs link directly to other function output from end to end.
